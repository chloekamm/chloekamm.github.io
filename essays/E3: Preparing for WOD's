This WOD was to create a sales receipt with different prices, sub-total, and taxes. You can find the link to this [Invoice1 WOD] (https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html) and the link to the questions for this assignment [here] (https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html).  I did this WOD a total of 3 times and the first time was a little tough. I think the most difficult thing for me was keeping track of all the syntax and format of what the functions needed to be. It was very easy to make a simple mistake with formatted, and therefore the output I was trying to do would not work. Another thing that slowed me down was having to change the number for each item, price, quantity, and product number. I originally was changing each number for each product individually; however, I know there is a much faster and easier way. 

Before this WOD, I often just tried to jump right into them and see how far I could get. From the previous WOD’s I often found myself stuck halfway through not knowing what to do. Before this WOD, I simply reviewed all the lecture material and notes. This actually helped me get through them faster because the information was fresh in my mind. I knew I could always refer to the screencast for help as well, but I tried my best not to look until I had to. After my first attempt I did look at the screencast because I was having trouble with the syntax of certain functions. The screencast helped to fix my simple mistakes, and I really did not have any issues after that. 

I overall thought this WOD was a lot of fun, and it was interesting to learn/use new code and put it into context. For the next WOD’s I will continue to prepare and read over the material before as well, since that helped me prepare for this one.
