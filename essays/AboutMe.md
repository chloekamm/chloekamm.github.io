Hi my name is Chloe Kam and I am originally from Seattle Washington. This is my second year at UH Manoa, currently studying MIS Business. I have always been interested into technology, so I figured this field would be a good fit for me. Today information systems is such a strong growing field, so I am very excited to learn about many different things and to see all the possibiities there are within the field itself. I think learning aspects of technology while connecting to the business world is really interesting, therefore I am looking forward to all the lessons and classes that I will be taking.
