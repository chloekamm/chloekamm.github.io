1.Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. Here is an example PPT prototype

![Untitled Notebook (1)-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89562552/145161039-a6b51474-33f6-4035-9095-7f1c891b65f0.jpg)


2. Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.

I think that I am going to have my shopping cart and the invoice seperate. One will just be from the user adding in items to the cart, where while in the shopping cart, they are able to add/delete items as well. Once they are satisfied with the items in the cart, they would be able to go to the invoice page (I would also prob call this "purchase"), and it would just like what we did in assignment 2. 

3. Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.

As of now, I have not really thought too deeply about the use of sessions and the data. However, I know the labs are very helpful when it comes to inputting this stuff in. 

5. How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?

We must address that the user cannot fully purchase items while not being logged in. Therefore, I will have to make sure the user is logged in at some point, and is stored in a session after a successful login. 

5. Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)

When a user is successfully logged in, I think I will have it send them back the products display page where they can continue shopping and selecting items. I will also provide a message that user is successfully logged in. 

6.If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?

I am not working with a partner. 

7. How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?

For this assignment, I am going to focus on doing one thing at a time. I often find myself overthinking simple things, so focusing on one thing after the other will help me. I also am going to think about how I can simplify things.
